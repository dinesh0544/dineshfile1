Git(golbal informationtracker): 
                         Git is a version controlling system and it is a source code management. it is a software which is installed on local managment.

VCS:
     version controlling system means controlling the multiple versions of the code.

1.git will takes the all developers code and its combines a single project.
2.git will stores the all versions of code.
3.git will tracks who is making the changes and what kind of modifications to the code.

They are 2 types of vcs

1.Disturbted version controlling system
2.centralized version controlling system

1.Disturbted version controlling system:
                                         Here we have the local repository at developer machine. i.e., you have the copy of code in developers machinelevel.
                                                         EX:GIT
2.centralized version controlling system: 
                                         Here we have  only centralized repository
                                                          EX:SVN
They are 3 work flows in git:

1. working directory
2.stagging area
3.local repository

1. working directory:
                      working directory is also called as "workspace"and this is the folder where the code is created and where the files present here are initially called as "untracked files".

2.stagging area:
                   This is also called "intermediate bufferzone".Here all files will be identified by your git. here files we called as" tracked file".

3.local repository:    This files are commited to local Rep to stagging area.
